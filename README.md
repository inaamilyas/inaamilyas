 ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Inam Ilyas, a passionate full-stack developer. Welcome to my GitHub profile!-

 
ðŸ’»I aced my studies (gold medal!) and love building websites! I'm skilled in both the front-end (how it looks) and back-end (how it works) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I even tackled real projects during school to gain experience.
ðŸŒŸ Thank you for visiting my profile. Let's make a difference with code!
